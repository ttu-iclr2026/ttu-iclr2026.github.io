Our third workshop on test-time updates will be held at ICLR 2026 in Rio de Janeiro!

.. 🚧 **The workshop site is still under construction. Check back for updates on Dec. 23 2025 and in the new year!** 🚧

**When and Where.** The workshop will be held on Apr. 26 or 27, to be determined by ICLR 2026, in Rio de Janeiro.

**Scope.** Note the scope encompasses test-time updates broadly.
This includes test-time adaptation, test-time training, post-training updates, and model editing.
As a workshop at ICLR, it is important to host and cross-pollinate work across different learning settings and domains.

Consider joining us to discover and contribute to the latest on updates after training: *the test begins now!*

Call for Papers
---------------

**Topics** We will welcome and highlight content on test-time and post-training updates:

- **Foundations & Objectives**: Unsupervised/self-supervised losses at test time; implicit/explicit regularization; stability–plasticity trade-offs; theory of adaptation and generalization under shift.
- **Parameterizations & Interfaces**: Input-space updates (learnable augmentations, prompts), feature-space adapters (BN/affine, LoRA adapters), head-level edits, retrieval-augmented updates, black-box query strategies for closed foundation models.
- **Shift, Attacks, & Tasks**: Coping with domain and style shift, distribution drift, adversarial perturbations, label shift, online continual learning and task switches, model availability attacks.
- **Adaptation of Foundational Models (FM)**: Adapting LLMs/VLMs and domain FMs to specialized/personalized settings via in-context learning, adapters/LoRA, TTU-RL, and model editing and unlearning.
- **Safety, Reliability, & Alignment**: Uncertainty, conformal prediction at test time, fallback/abstention, guardrails and risk monitors, privacy-preserving updates, auditability, and roll-back.
- **Dynamic Architectures**: Recurrent depth models, looped transformers, dynamically allocating compute (early-exit networks, mixture-of-depth), and iterative test-time optimization (deep equilibrium networks, implicit computation).
- **Metrics, Datasets, & Benchmarks**: End-to-end metrics that couple utility (accuracy, calibration) with costs (compute, memory, wall-clock, energy); realistic streams and recurrences; reproducible TTU pipelines.
- **Cost-Aware & Green TTU**: Methods and evaluations under compute/energy budgets, latency/throughput targets, edge constraints, carbon accounting, and cost–quality frontiers; any improvement must justify its operational footprint.

**Keywords** Adaptation, Continual Learning, Robustness, Personalization, Model Editing, Foundation Models, Reliability, Green AI.

**Format**
We will welcome the submission of short papers (= 4 pages content, not including the references, as well as an (optional) appendix with an unlimited number of pages).
We will also welcome the submission of tiny papers (= 2 pages content, not including the references, without an appendix).
Accepted submissions will be selected for poster, lightning talk (= 1 slide in 1 minute), and oral presentation at the workshop.
The workshop will not include proceedings.
